Specifications
 If necessary, learn the rules of Blackjack by researching it on the web. For this
program:
 If the player doesn’t bust by going over 21 points, the dealer must continue
taking cards until the dealer has at least 17 points.
 Don’t allow a player to “split” a hand or “double down.”
 The program should accept integer or float entries for the bet amount.
 Getting a blackjack pays out 3:2, which is 1.5 times the bet amount.
 The program should round the blackjack payout to a maximum of two decimal
places.
