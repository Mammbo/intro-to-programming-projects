Specifications
 Use the locale module to display the amount of money in the format for your current
locale.
 Make sure the program doesn’t yield incorrect money amounts due to floating-point
errors.
 When the program starts, display the start time at the top of the console using the 12-
hour format and include hours, minutes, and seconds.
 When the program ends, display the end time using the 12-hour format as well as the
amount of time that elapsed while the program was running.
 Use a dictionary to store the data for each card: rank, suit, and points. This shouldn’t
change the functionality of the program, but it should make the code easier to read
and understand.
