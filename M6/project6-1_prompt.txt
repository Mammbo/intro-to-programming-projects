Specifications
 A prime number is divisible by two factors (1 and itself). For example, 7 is a prime number because it
is only divisible by 1 and 7.
 If the user enters an integer that’s not between 1 and 5000, the program should display an error
message.
 If the number is a prime number, the program should display a message to that effect.
 If the number is not a prime number, the program should display a message to that effect. Then, it
should display the number of factors for the number and a list of those factors.
 Store the factors for each number in a list.
 Use functions to organize the code for this program.
