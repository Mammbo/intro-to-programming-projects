Specifications
 Your instructor should provide a CSV file named prospects.csv that contains a list of prospects.
 Your program should fix the formatting problems and write a file named prospects_clean.csv.
 All names should use title case. To convert a string to title case, you can call the title() method from
the string.
 All email addresses should use lowercase. To convert a string to lowercase, you can call the lower()
method from the string.
 All extra spaces at the start or end of a string should be removed. To do that, you can call the strip()
method from the string.
