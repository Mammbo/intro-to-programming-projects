# COSC-1315 Python Projects 

These are some of the projects that were assigned to me for my intro to programming class from the book Murach's Python Programming. The projects will be from modules 1 - 13 of the book. 

I am excited to start my programming journey and can't wait to show off my projects !

Feel free to open an issue and let me know on what I can improve or if anything isn't working/is off.
