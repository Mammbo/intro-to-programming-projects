Specifications
 The program should roll two six-sided dice.
 Store the code that rolls a single die in a function.
 Store the code that gets input and displays output in the main() function. Divide this code into
functions whenever you think it would make that code easier to read and maintain.
 The program should display a special message for two ones (snake eyes) and two sixes (boxcars).
